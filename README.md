# wallpaperbot

This is a simple program that picks a random image from my directory of wallpapers to post to the subreddit r\wallpapers

Note: The reddit API only supports submissions that are links or text post. Because of this I actually use imgurs api to post my photo to imgur, retrieve the image link, and then submit that link to reddit.
